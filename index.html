        Born in Quezon City, and lived in different parts of NCR. In my life I
        have lived in 3 different homes. These 3 homes emphasized the different
        stages of my life. I grew up in Caloocan City where I learned all the
        basics of being a child. Then we moved to Quezon City where I learned
        what being a teenager was like. Last, but not the least, I am now living
        in Manila, where I will learn how to be an adult.
